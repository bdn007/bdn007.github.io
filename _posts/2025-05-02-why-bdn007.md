I landed in Qatar on Friday 29 Sep 2006 to get ready for my first day of work at [Maersk Oil Qatar](https://x.com/maerskoilqatar) on Sun 01 Oct. At that time, Qatar Airways had 4 flights a week, that explained the half of the reason why I came early. The other half is that I wanted to spend sometime with my friends, who I met in Baku. 

Unbeknown to me, my fate is tied to <strong>bnd007</strong>. It is the <strong>initials</strong> that assigned to each and everyone. It is something very Danish I believe. It has become my identifier, my email and almost everything at work.
