<h1>Welcome to Bao Ngo's Homepage</h1>

<p>
  After 20+ years in Qatar, I am reaching the retirement age so I am leaving the country and
  <a href="https://www.noc.qa">North Oil Company - NOC</a> in Feb 2028. It was a decision I made after thoughtful
  reflection and preparation with my Family, Manager and Team. I am forever grateful for the support, encouragement, and
  gracious sendoff Engineering & Construction provided as I made this huge change for my family.
</p>

<p>
  I am even more grateful for the experience and friendship that I had while at NOC and
  <a href="https://x.com/maerskoilqatar"> Maersk Oil Qatar - MOQ</a>. For those that I missed in my email send off, or
  those that have already left NOC and MOQ: thank you for your collaboration and shared commitment to the companies and
  industry we served. Please stay in touch as I return to rural of Vietnam and plant as many trees as I can to offset my
  carbon footprint.
